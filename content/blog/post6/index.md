subtitle: "Custom cable sleeves and hardline water cooling"
summary: Over the past 6 years I customized my PC to my likings. This includes creating custom sleeved cables with precise routing, a hardline watercooling loop for the CPU and lots of RGB lighting controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller.

## Custom sleeved cables

My PC case, the Phanteks Enthoo Evolv, features tempered glass panels on both sides. This means there is no place to hide cables and without proper cable management, my PC looked like a mess. To fix this, I purchased a modular power supply unit from Corsair and created my own set of cables. Each wire is cut to length individually and routed using custom brackets made from aluminium. This way, no wires are loose and there is no leftover cables that need to be stashed somewhere. Both ends were crimped and connected to ATX/Molex terminals.

To improve the looks even further, each wire was sleeved in either red or carbon grey to go along with the color theme of the hardware.
