## Head First Design Patterns

Head First Design Patterns is an engaging and accessible introduction to design patterns in software development. The book uses a visually rich format to explain concepts in a way that is easy to understand. It covers a wide range of design patterns, including creational, structural, and behavioral patterns, and provides practical examples to illustrate their use. The patterns are applicable in any object-oriented programming language, making it a valuable resource for developers looking to improve their software design skills. This book was my first introduction to design patterns, since then my understanding of software design has grown significantly. I still find myself referring to it when I need a refresher on certain patterns or concepts.

## Game Programming Patterns

{{< /figMinipage >}}
Similar to Head First Design Patterns, but with the focus game development. It explores common design patterns used in game programming, such as the Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern, State pattern, and Command pattern. The book provides practical examples and explanations of how these patterns can be applied to create efficient and maintainable game code. It's a great resource for both aspiring and experienced game developers looking to enhance their understanding of software design in the context of game development. If you have worked with game engines like Unity or Unreal, you will find many of the patterns familiar. If, like me, you have ever wondered why the developers designed parts of the engine the way they did, then you will find the answers in this book.
