title: Learning Surrogate Models for Fluid Dynamics
subtitle: "Seminar paper at KIT"
summary: "Can the physical principles underlying expensive fluid dynamics simulations be approximated by neural networks? To answer this question, a literature review is conducted and various current research approaches are compared. Fundamental architectures such as CNNs, GNNs, and LSTMs are introduced, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed based on the literature. The results show that neural networks are capable of approximating fluid simulations, often faster than traditional numerical methods."
