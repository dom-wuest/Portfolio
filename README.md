# Portfolio

This is my [Portfolio Website](https://dom-wuest.de), containing posts about my research, development projects and other things I find interesting. 

## Building the Site

1) Clone the repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/dom-wuest/Portfolio
```
2) Install Hugo on your system. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
3) Build a local version of the site by executing `hugo server`. You can see the site by navigating to `http://localhost:1313/` (URL will be outputted in the CLI) in a browser.

## Modifications to the Qubt Theme
The Qubt theme has been modified to suit my needs. The main changes include:
- Removed Grid layout for posts
- Added language toggle
- Support for different image layouts
- Responsive layout for posts card_images on mobile
